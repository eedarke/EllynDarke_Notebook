RNA Extraction for Bulk RNA-seq Bleaching Experiment
samples: 66

Step 1: Homogenization
1. Thaw samples to room temperature 
2. Vortex samples on 10rpm for 15 mins
3. Allow samples to rest for 5 mins
4. Vortex samples on 10rpm for 15 mins
5. Place samples back in the freezer 

Step 2: RNA Extractions using Quick-RNA Miniprep Plus Protocol
1. Prepare Proteinase K at 60mg of PK: 3120ul of PK Storage Buffer
2. Prepare master mix of Proteinase K at 15ul of PK Storage Buffer x 70 samples (gice yourself wiggle room) : 30ul of PK Digestion Buffer  x 70 samples
