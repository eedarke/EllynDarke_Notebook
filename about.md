Hello! Welcome to my lab notebook! I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School for Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science in the [Cnidarian Immunity Laboratory] (https://www.cnidarianimmunitylab.com). My research aims to investigate how genotypic variation influences the differential expression of coral genetic pathways under thermal stress using bulk molecular approaches to understand how corals will respond to future climate change stressors. If you have questions about my research or have suggestions for improvement, please contact me at [ellyndarke@gmail.com](mailto:ellyndarke@gmail.com)
