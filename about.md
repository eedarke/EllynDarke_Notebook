Hello! Welcome to my lab notebook! I am currently a PhD student at the University of North Carolina Wilmington working in the [Coral REEF (Reproductive and Evolutionary Ecology-Fogarty) Laboratory](https://www.nicolefogarty.com/) and the [Warner Laboratory](https://warnerlab.org/). My current research aims to utilize transgenics to genetically engineer corals to be more resilient to rising ocean temperatures. I received by Bachelors of Science in Marine and Atmospheric Science with a concentration in Marine Biology and Ecology from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School for Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science where I worked in the [Cnidarian Immunity Laboratory] (https://www.cnidarianimmunitylab.com). My past research used bulk molecular approaches to investigate how genotypic variation influences the differential expression of coral genetic pathways under thermal stress and understand how corals will respond to future climate change stressors. If you have questions about my research or have suggestions for improvement, please contact me at [ellyndarke@gmail.com](mailto:ellyndarke@gmail.com)
